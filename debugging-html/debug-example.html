    <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unclosed elements:
        <strong>
          If an element is not closed properly, then its effect can spread to
          areas you didn't intend
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important
        for code behaving correctly.
        <em>strong emphasised?</em>
        <strong>what is this?</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look
        at an example:
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">
          link to Mozilla homepage
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
