  <h1>HTML debugging examples</h1>

  <p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly, </strong>then its effect can spread to areas
      you didn't intend</li>
    <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly.
      <em><strong>strong strong emphasised? what is this?</strong></em></li>
    <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a
        href="https://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla Firefox</a></li>
  </ul>
